# Motorized-wheelchair-
Being in my fifth semester, I collaborated with "Bosco sobre ruedas" to design a wheelchair with an integrated motorized 5th wheel.


Initially, the project was planned for us to design the chair in its entirety, but due to the time available our project changed to only design the fifth wheel and include it in the wheelchair.

During this project, I was involved in both the wheelchair and fifth wheel designs, as well as performing the force analysis directly in SolidWorks. At the same time, I contributed to the recollection of information on engineering standards and the current situation that which people who use wheelchairs live in Mexico.
